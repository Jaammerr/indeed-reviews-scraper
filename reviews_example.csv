Flexible hours doing batch orders.   What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Waiting on next job too much lag time.   What is the work environment and culture like at the company? At the moment business is overrun with drivers hard to get orders.   What is a typical day like for you at the company?

Unfortunately for the past month to 2 months there have been spanish drivers with florida license plates come here and get all the orders. If they are there you will not get an offer and if you do it won't be a good one. Spark and walmart do not care. We are all reporting them and nothing is getting done.
Spark Driver™,"February 18, 2024",Tempe,AZ,Driver,True,3,0,0,0,0,0,Driver for deliveries,Spark uses to be good. The pay is low and a lot of drivers have multiple phones.  They also use one car with multiple people in it when it's only supposed to be one person.
Spark Driver™,"February 17, 2024",La Crosse,WI,Delivery Driver,True,1,0,0,0,0,0,Walmart does not value drivers,"Walmart skims tips off of drivers, driver support is rarely helpful, orders can take up to 1.5 hours to come out to car.

Spark Driver™,"February 16, 2024",Naples,FL,Independent Contract Driver,True,3,3,1,3,1,3,Contract Driver,"Spark has inconsistent work availability. Some days their are alot of offers & other days you may not have any offers for hours leaving you feeling like the day was just wasted time. This position should be treated as a side gig unless you are in a very high demand area. Their are no health benefits nor vehichle discounts. Working closely with Wal-Mart & Sam's Club, one might think a driver would at least receive routine car maintenance discounts, sadly though you don't. If you meet their meteric scores, the driver receives one month of Wal-Mart Plus Membership which in turn gets you 10 cents off at Murphy Gas locations. In my opinion, that is not enough. As a contract driver you are literally putting your life on the line everyday to see that customers receive their purchases however I feel completely unseen & cared for as an ""employee"". The flexibility & customer interactions are the only reasons I continue working on their platform."

The app had quirks sometimes but mostly good.  Was making decent money too until out of the blue my account was locked and like 3 weeks later they finally said it was because ""a store or customer didn't receive their order"" and that was it.  I don't know why - could have been stolen, customer lied, or may have been my mistake delivering to wrong house since the app wouldn't always pass the right address to Google Maps (need a GPS app to navigate to delivery location)."

It's doesn't pay at all. Unless you stay out all day from sunrise to sunset   What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Getting the orders that come out.  And the pay suck   What is the work environment and culture like at the company? They don't have one. If you like to sit and watch people thats what you will do all day   What is a typical day like for you at the company? Sitting and watching people  all day that walmart. Waiting for orders
Spark Driver™,"February 12, 2024",Union City,CA,Delivery Driver,True,2,0,0,0,0,0,To much waiting for offers,Long wait time.  App issues.   Tip baiting.  You can be in the right and still have the blame on you.   It's good for little side money.  Not a full time job
Spark Driver™,"February 12, 2024",Douglasville,GA,Delivery Driver,True,3,2,2,1,1,1,"Flexible and decent pay, but no support.","The best part about the job is the flexibility it affords you, that makes it very family friendly. I can even take my 5 year old son with me on occasion when he wants to go. The job isn't difficult at all and there isn't really any pressure.    At first glance, the pay is decent. I make on average about $1200 a week. That looks great, until you understand that taxes haven't been take out, so you have to pay those. Also, gas and vehicle maintenance are a huge expense.   The only major complaint I have is support, there isn't any. They used to be really good at providing support and helping if you had any issues, but that's changed. When you call support, you get multiple recorded messages telling you everything that support will no longer help you with and telling you that you should be able so solve most of the issues on your own. And when you do get an agent, they just say they can't help. I have to call back repeatedly, getting a different agent each time, until I luck up and find one that can help me.  Overall, not bad and you can earn a decent wage if you are willing to work a lot of hours. Just no there isn't much backend support if you have any issues."

I could make anywhere from $500-$800 weekly in a small town. A year or so later, it’s almost impossible to get a decent run because apparently bots have taken over and they are getting 90% of the decent orders while others such as myself sit in the Walmart parking lot just waiting. IF you’re lucky, you may get an order for $10 and have 4 stops and no tips. And the pickup and delivery managers can be rude and quick to have you deactivated for almost nothing at all. If you are just starting, good luck. You’re going to need it."

Some days their are alot of offers & other days you may not have any offers for hours leaving you feeling like the day was just wasted time. This position should be treated as a side gig unless you are in a very high demand area. Their are no health benefits nor vehichle discounts. Working closely with Wal-Mart & Sam's Club, one might think a driver would at least receive routine car maintenance discounts, sadly though you don't. If you meet their meteric scores, the driver receives one month of Wal-Mart Plus Membership which in turn gets you 10 cents off at Murphy Gas locations. In my opinion, that is not enough. As a contract driver you are literally putting your life on the line everyday to see that customers receive their purchases however I feel completely unseen & cared for as an ""employee"".

I can even take my 5 year old son with me on occasion when he wants to go. The job isn't difficult at all and there isn't really any pressure.    At first glance, the pay is decent. I make on average about $1200 a week. That looks great, until you understand that taxes haven't been take out, so you have to pay those. Also, gas and vehicle maintenance are a huge expense.   The only major complaint I have is support, there isn't any. They used to be really good at providing support and helping if you had any issues, but that's changed. When you call support, you get multiple recorded messages telling you everything that support will no longer help you with and telling you that you should be able so solve most of the issues on your own. And when you do get an agent, they just say they can't help. I have to call back repeatedly, getting a different agent each time, until I luck up and find one that can help me.

I can even take my 5 year old son with me on occasion when he wants to go. The job isn't difficult at all and there isn't really any pressure.    At first glance, the pay is decent. I make on average about $1200 a week. That looks great, until you understand that taxes haven't been take out, so you have to pay those. Also, gas and vehicle maintenance are a huge expense.   The only major complaint I have is support, there isn't any. They used to be really good at providing support and helping if you had any issues, but that's changed. When you call support, you get multiple recorded messages telling you everything that support will no longer help you with and telling you that you should be able so solve most of the issues on your own. And when you do get an agent, they just say they can't help. I have to call back repeatedly, getting a different agent each time, until I luck up and find one that can help me.  Overall, not bad and you can earn a decent wage if you are willing to work a lot of hours. Just no there isn't much backend support if you have any issues."
